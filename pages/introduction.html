    <h2>Understanding Bangladesh's Economic Journey</h2>
    <p>
      Emerging from the devastation of the 1971 Liberation War, Bangladesh has transformed from a predominantly agrarian, aid-dependent economy into one of Asia's most remarkable development success stories. With a GDP growth rate consistently exceeding 6% annually since 2011 and reaching peaks of 7-8% in recent years, Bangladesh has outperformed many of its regional peers despite significant structural constraints.
    </p>
    
    <div class="subtle-box">
      <h3>Key Economic Indicators (2023)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>GDP:</strong> Approximately $460 billion (PPP)</li>
        <li><strong>GDP Per Capita:</strong> $2,688</li>
        <li><strong>Poverty Rate:</strong> Reduced from 44.2% in 1991 to 12.9% in 2022</li>
        <li><strong>Human Development Index:</strong> 0.661 (Medium human development category)</li>
        <li><strong>Foreign Exchange Reserves:</strong> $25.16 billion</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    
    <p>
      The economic development model of Bangladesh has been characterized by pragmatic policy choices that balanced state intervention with market-oriented reforms. The country has strategically leveraged its comparative advantage in labor-intensive manufacturing, particularly in the ready-made garment (RMG) sector, which now accounts for over 80% of export earnings and employs approximately 4.4 million workers, predominantly women.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Bangladesh's graduation from Least Developed Country (LDC) status, expected in 2026, marks a watershed moment in its development trajectory. This transition brings both opportunities and challenges, as the country will gradually lose preferential trade access and concessional financing while attempting to reach upper-middle-income status by 2031 and developed-country status by 2041.
    </p>
    
    <div class="highlight">
      <p><strong>Development Milestone:</strong> In 2015, Bangladesh achieved lower-middle-income status according to World Bank classifications, demonstrating remarkable progress from its "basket case" designation in the 1970s.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>
      The country's resilience is perhaps best exemplified by its consistent economic growth despite recurring natural disasters, political instability, and global economic shocks. This resilience has been bolstered by a robust civil society, a growing entrepreneurial class, a dynamic microfinance sector, and strategic investments in human capital and infrastructure.
    </p>
    
    <p class="humor">
      "From boat rides to boardrooms, our journey is as inspiring as it is entertainingâ€”a nation that went from being called a 'basket case' to becoming a 'development surprise' faster than you can say 'digital Bangladesh'!"
