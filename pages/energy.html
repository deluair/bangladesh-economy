    <p class="humor">
      "In Bangladesh, we've become experts at managing power outages—our electricity used to play hide and seek with us! Now we're transitioning to renewables, and there's a national identity crisis brewing: what will Bangladeshis talk about if not power cuts? Perhaps we'll have to resort to discussing the weather like the British!"
