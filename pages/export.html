    <h2>Expanding the Export Base: Strategic Imperatives</h2>
    
    <p>
      Bangladesh's remarkable export growth has been predominantly driven by the Ready-Made Garments (RMG) sector, which accounts for approximately 83% of total export earnings ($46.99 billion in FY2022-23). This concentration presents a significant vulnerability in the country's export portfolio, particularly as Bangladesh prepares to graduate from Least Developed Country (LDC) status in 2026.
    </p>
    
    <div class="subtle-box">
      <h3>Export Concentration Metrics</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Product Concentration:</strong> Bangladesh's export basket has a Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) of 0.73, indicating extremely high concentration compared to regional peers like Vietnam (0.31) and India (0.19).</li>
        <li><strong>Market Concentration:</strong> 58% of exports are destined for the European Union and the United States, creating vulnerability to economic slowdowns in these markets.</li>
        <li><strong>Value Chain Position:</strong> Approximately 75% of RMG exports are in the lower-value "cut, make, and trim" (CMT) segment, with limited participation in design, branding, or marketing.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    
    <h3>Emerging Export Sectors</h3>
    
    <p>
      Several non-RMG sectors are showing promising export growth potential and warrant targeted policy support:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pharmaceuticals:</strong> Exporting to over 150 countries with annual growth of 18.7% and a global market share approaching 0.2%. The sector benefits from the country's TRIPS waiver until 2033 and has established capabilities in generic formulations.</li>
      
      <li><strong>IT/ITES:</strong> Export earnings of $1.4 billion in FY2022-23 with a 25% CAGR over the past five years. Bangladesh has over 300,000 IT professionals and 4,500 software and IT service companies, with particular strengths in business process outsourcing and freelance services.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Light Engineering:</strong> Export value of $795 million in FY2022-23, primarily in bicycle manufacturing (second-largest exporter to the EU), agricultural machinery, and electronics components.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Agro-processing:</strong> Export earnings of $1.1 billion in FY2022-23, with processed food, vegetables, and fruits showing strong potential. Major exports include frozen shrimp, processed vegetables, and tea.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Leather and Footwear:</strong> Export value of $1.24 billion in FY2022-23, benefiting from shifting production from China. The newly established Savar Tannery Industrial Estate aims to improve environmental compliance and product quality.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Strategic Policy Framework for Export Diversification</h3>
    
    <p>
      The Export Policy 2021-2024 and the 8th Five Year Plan have prioritized export diversification through targeted interventions:
    </p>
    
    <div class="highlight">
      <h4>Key Policy Instruments</h4>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Market Access Enhancement:</strong> Pursuing comprehensive economic partnership agreements with post-LDC graduation priority markets (Japan, India, China, UK) and streamlining Rules of Origin certification processes.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Export Incentives Reform:</strong> Transitioning from direct cash subsidies (which may face WTO challenges post-graduation) to compliant support measures like innovation grants, quality certification assistance, and market development co-financing.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Special Economic Zones:</strong> Developing sector-specific zones with customized infrastructure (e.g., active pharmaceutical ingredient parks, agro-processing zones) to address production constraints.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Standards Compliance Support:</strong> Upgrading the Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institution (BSTI) and sector-specific testing facilities to meet international standards and certification requirements.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Export Financing:</strong> Expanding the capacity of the Export Development Fund from $7.5 billion to $10 billion and developing specialized financial products for emerging export sectors with distinct working capital requirements.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    
    <p>
      While the Ready-Made Garments sector remains the crown jewel of exports, Bangladesh's sustainable growth trajectory demands a diversified export basket that leverages the country's evolving comparative advantages in pharmaceuticals, IT services, light engineering, and agro-processing. Coordinated policy interventions across trade facilitation, industrial infrastructure, skills development, and standards compliance are essential to achieve this diversification imperative.
