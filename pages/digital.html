    </div>
    
    <h4>4. Digital Society</h4>
    
    <p>

    <h3>Strategic Challenges and Policy Priorities</h3>
    
    <p>
      Despite impressive progress, Bangladesh's digital transformation faces several structural challenges requiring targeted policy interventions:
    </p>
    
    <div class="highlight">
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Digital Divide:</strong> Persistent disparities exist across urban-rural, gender, and socioeconomic dimensions:
          <ul>
            <li>Rural internet adoption (61%) lags urban areas (87%).</li>
            <li>Women are 33% less likely than men to use the internet.</li>
            <li>Only 14% of the population has advanced digital skills.</li>
          </ul>
          The Digital Literacy for All program aims to train 5 million citizens annually in tiered digital skills curricula.
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>Digital Trust and Security:</strong> Cybersecurity incidents increased by 164% between 2019-2023, while only 34% of critical information infrastructure meets advanced security standards. The National Cybersecurity Strategy 2022-2027 prioritizes capacity building for the National Computer Incident Response Team and implements mandatory security standards for critical sectors.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Digital Business Environment:</strong> Regulatory frameworks have struggled to keep pace with technological innovation:
          <ul>
            <li>The Bangladesh Startup Regulatory Commission is streamlining approval processes for innovative business models.</li>
            <li>The Open API Initiative is creating interoperability standards for financial and government services.</li>
            <li>The Digital Competition Policy is addressing emerging challenges in platform economics and data monopolies.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>Digital Innovation Ecosystem:</strong> While startup activity is growing, the ecosystem faces funding and scaling challenges. The Startup Bangladesh Limited (SBL) sovereign fund has invested $20 million in 93 startups, aiming to catalyze $250 million in private venture capital by 2025.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    
    <p>
      Bangladesh's digital transformation represents a paradigm shift in its development approach, leveraging technology to overcome traditional constraints and create new pathways for inclusive growth. As the country navigates the next phase of this journey, balancing innovation with inclusion and growth with regulatory prudence will be essential to realizing the full potential of Digital Bangladesh.
