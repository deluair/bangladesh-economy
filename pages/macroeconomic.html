    <h2>Re-establishing Macroeconomic Stability</h2>
    <p>
      Following a period of remarkable macroeconomic stability from 2010-2019, Bangladesh's economy has encountered significant headwinds due to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent global economic disruptions. These challenges have been exacerbated by the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which triggered worldwide inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions that severely impacted Bangladesh's import-dependent economy.
    </p>
    
    <div class="highlight">
      <p><strong>Current Challenges (2023-2024):</strong> Foreign exchange reserves declined from $46 billion in 2021 to approximately $25 billion in 2023, while inflation peaked at 9.9% in August 2022 and has remained persistently high. The Bangladesh Taka (BDT) experienced a 25% depreciation against the US dollar between 2022-2023.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h3>Fiscal Policy Framework</h3>
    <p>
      Bangladesh faces a critical challenge in its low tax-to-GDP ratio, which stands at approximately 8.5%—one of the lowest among comparable economies. This constrains the government's fiscal space for essential public investments. The National Board of Revenue (NBR) has initiated comprehensive reforms, including:
    </p>
    
    <div class="subtle-box">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Tax Policy Modernization:</strong> Implementing a simplified Direct Tax Code and expanding the tax base through digital integration of tax identification systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Revenue Enhancement:</strong> Introducing progressive property taxes in urban areas and rationalizing tax incentives to reduce revenue leakage.</li>
        <li><strong>Expenditure Rationalization:</strong> Implementing performance-based budgeting and reducing subsidies to loss-making state-owned enterprises.</li>
        <li><strong>Public Debt Management:</strong> Maintaining the debt-to-GDP ratio below 40% (currently 38.8%) while enhancing the efficiency of public investments.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    
    <h3>Monetary Policy Stance</h3>
    <p>
      Bangladesh Bank has adopted a contractionary monetary policy stance to combat inflation while supporting economic growth. Key policy interventions include:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Increasing the policy rate (repo rate) from 4.75% in 2021 to 7.75% in 2023 to curb inflationary pressures.</li>
      <li>Implementing a flexible exchange rate regime after a prolonged period of a de facto pegged exchange rate.</li>
      <li>Introducing macro-prudential measures to reduce non-essential imports and preserve foreign exchange reserves.</li>
      <li>Developing domestic capital markets to reduce dependence on bank financing and create alternative saving instruments.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      The International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a $4.7 billion support package in January 2023 to bolster Bangladesh's balance of payments and support structural reforms. This program includes provisions for enhancing fiscal transparency, strengthening the financial sector, and improving governance frameworks.
    </p>

      <p><strong>Expert Analysis:</strong> While short-term stabilization measures are necessary, Bangladesh's long-term macroeconomic resilience hinges on structural reforms to enhance productivity, diversify exports, and develop a more sophisticated financial system that can efficiently intermediate between savers and investors.</p>

      "Like a seasoned juggler keeping multiple balls in the air—macroeconomic stability is our art. Though sometimes it feels more like juggling flaming torches while riding a unicycle on a tightrope over the Bay of Bengal!"
